## Requirements
varVAMP runs on UNIX Systems, MacOSX and Windows with Python3 >=3.9 installed.

## Installation

### PyPI:

```shell
pip install varvamp
```

### CONDA:

```shell
 conda install -c bioconda varvamp
```

### DOCKER:

```shell
docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/varvamp:<current_tag>
```

That was already it. To check if it worked:

```shell
varvamp -v
```
You should see the current varVAMP version.

### BLAST module

If you want to use varVAMPs blast module to predict off-targets, make sure that you have installed [BLASTN](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/doc/blast-help/downloadblastdata.html#downloadblastdata) and created a local blast database containing sequences of potential off-targets.


## Installation for advanced customization or development

All varVAMP options (such as temperature, size, penalties) can be customized in the `config.py`. However, to do this you will have to install varVAMP not from the PyPI repository, but directly from this GitHub repository.

### - via pip (recommended)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jonas-fuchs/varVAMP
cd varVAMP
pip install .
varvamp -v
```

### - via requirements.txt

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jonas-fuchs/varVAMP
cd varVAMP
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 varvamp -v
```
